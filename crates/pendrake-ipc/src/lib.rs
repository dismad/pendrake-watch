//! Wire protocol between the Pendrake daemon and the GUI client.
//!
//! Transport is a Unix-domain socket carrying newline-delimited JSON: one
//! [`Request`] per line from the client, one [`Response`] per line back, matched
//! by `id`. After a client sends `subscribeEvents`, the daemon also pushes
//! [`SyncEvent`] lines down that same connection as the wallet scans. A pushed
//! event carries `event`; a reply carries `ok`/`id`, so a reader tells them apart
//! without a wrapper frame. The SPEC's eventual length-prefixed bincode codec and
//! auth-token handshake land in later milestones.
//!
//! Domain types use camelCase so they map field-for-field onto the GUI's
//! TypeScript contract.
